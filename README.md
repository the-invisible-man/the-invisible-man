- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos. Born in Lima, Peru. A Belleville, NJ son. Living in Brooklyn.
- 👀 I've come to understand why computers are "a bycicle for the mind".
- 🌱 I've always appreciated how problem solving explans the world around me.
- 💞️ I like playing music too, so I'm down to collab. My favorite band is Queen, and The Police; even in The Police's punk years too.
