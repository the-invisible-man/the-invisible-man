- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos, family calls me Nicolas. Born in Lima, Peru 🇵🇪. A Belleville, NJ son. Living in Brooklyn. Started my journey with computers at 12 years old.
- 👀 I've come to understand why computers are "a bycicle for the mind".
- 🌱 I've always appreciated how problem solving explans the world around me.
- 💞️ I like playing music. My favorite band is Queen, and The Police; even in The Police's punk years too.
- 📫 I'm on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosngranados and insta: https://www.instagram.com/carl.osx
- 🙌🏼 Looks like I'm a Github repo now? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- 👫 Github wants to be more social now, and I like it. I think more of us could grab a drink together.
- 🌙 As much as I like dark themes, I'm having a hard time reviewing code with Github's dark theme 😩
